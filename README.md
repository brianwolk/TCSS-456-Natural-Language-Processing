# TCSS-456-Natural-Language-Processing
Some scripts and a project I created in a senior level elective class studying natural language processing, a field of AI focused on programming computers to analyze and process human languages.

The focus of the class was on learning the field of NLP so there was not evaluation based on the code itself such as structure/commenting, rather my ability to write scripts and perform meaningful tasks using Python and the principles of NLP taught in the course.
