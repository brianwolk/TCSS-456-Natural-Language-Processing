# TCSS-456-Natural-Language-Processing
Some scripts and a project I created in a senior level elective class studying natural language processing, a field of AI focused on programming computers to analyze and process human languages.

The focus of the class was on learning the field of NLP so there was not evaluation based on the code itself ie structure/commenting, however it demonstrates my ability to write scripts and perform meaningful tasks using Python though the bulk of my Computer Science education was not taught in that language.
